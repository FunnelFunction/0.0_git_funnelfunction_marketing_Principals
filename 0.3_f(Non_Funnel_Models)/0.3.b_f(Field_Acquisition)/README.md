**Customer Acquisition as Field Dynamics**

*Paper in development*

---

## Core Thesis

Customer acquisition is the **alignment of fields**, not push through stages:
- **Φ** = Offer field (what you're selling)
- **Ψ** = Demand field (what market wants)
- **f(Acquisition)** = Φ ∩ Ψ (intersection)

---

## Key Equation

```
f(Acquisition_rate) = ∫∫ Φ(x) · Ψ(x) dx
```

Maximize the overlap integral, not the funnel volume.

---

## Planned Content

1. Field representation of offers and demand
2. Computing field overlap
3. Optimization strategies
4. Dynamic field adaptation
