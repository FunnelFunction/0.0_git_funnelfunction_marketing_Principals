# 0.3.b f(Field_Acquisition)

**Customer Acquisition as Field Dynamics**

Mapping the ICHTB coordinate system to market acquisition geometry.

---

## Abstract

Customer acquisition is not push through stages—it is **alignment of fields**. The offer field Φ and demand field Ψ must intersect across all six recursive fan surfaces of the ICHTB. Acquisition is maximized by computing the **overlap integral**, not by increasing funnel volume.

---

## Part 1: Field Theory of Markets

### The Core Insight

```
f(Acquisition) = Φ ∩ Ψ
```

Where:
- **Φ** = Offer field (what you're selling)
- **Ψ** = Demand field (what market wants)
- **∩** = Intersection (alignment across all dimensions)

### The Overlap Integral

```
f(Acquisition_rate) = ∫∫ Φ(x) · Ψ(x) dx
```

**Maximize the overlap integral, not the funnel volume.**

This changes the fundamental question:
- Funnel: "How do we push more people through?"
- Field: "Where do our fields already overlap?"

---

## Part 2: The ICHTB Acquisition Geometry

### The Inverse Cartesian + Heisenberg Tensor Box

The ICHTB provides a 6-surface computational shell for evaluating field alignment. Each face Δᵢ is a **recursive operator gate**, not a geometric surface.

## Part 3: The Six-Gate Acquisition Protocol

### Gate 1: Δ₁ — Gradient Alignment (∇Φ)

**Question:** Does the market pull toward your offer?

```
∇Φ = (∂Φ/∂x, ∂Φ/∂y, ∂Φ/∂z)
```

Acquisition requires a non-zero gradient:
- If ∇Φ = 0: No pull exists (equilibrium = no movement)
- If ∇Φ ≠ 0: Market is being pulled toward something

**Measurement:**
- Search volume trends
- Intent signals in GA4
- Demand curve slope

**Gate Pass Condition:**
```
|∇Φ| > θ_min
```

### Gate 2: Δ₂ — Memory Loop (∇×F)

**Question:** Does your brand create recursive memory?

```
∇×F = Curl of the field = Phase memory
```

Memory loops form when the curl is non-zero:
- If ∇×F = 0: Recursion disperses (forgotten)
- If ∇×F ≠ 0: Phase memory exists (recalled)

**Measurement:**
- Brand recall scores
- Category Entry Points (CEPs)
- Unaided awareness

**Gate Pass Condition:**
```
∮ F⃗ · dℓ⃗ ≠ 0  (closed loop integral non-zero)
```

### Gate 3: Δ₃ — Expansion Permission (+∇²Φ)

**Question:** Is there room for your offer to expand?

```
+∇²Φ > 0 = Diffusive shell expansion
```

Positive Laplacian means tension flows outward:
- Market is receptive to new entrants
- Category is growing
- Budget permits scaling

**Measurement:**
- TAM growth rate
- Competitive density
- Media cost trends

**Gate Pass Condition:**
```
∇²Φ > 0 in target segments
```

### Gate 4: Δ₄ — Compression Lock (-∇²Φ)

**Question:** Can you lock conversions?

```
-∇²Φ < 0 = Curvature convergence
```

Negative Laplacian means tension densifies:
- Decisions can be finalized
- Friction is overcome
- Commitments are made

**Measurement:**
- Cart completion rates
- Contract signature velocity
- Payment processing success

**Gate Pass Condition:**
```
∇²Φ = constant, d/dt(∇²Φ) = 0  (shell lock achieved)
```

### Gate 5: Δ₅ — Temporal Emergence (∂Φ/∂t)

**Question:** Is the timing right?

```
∂Φ/∂t = Rate of intent change over time
```

Emergence happens when:
- ∂Φ/∂t → 0: Stabilization (decision crystallizes)
- ∂Φ/∂t ≠ 0: Still evolving (not ready)

**Measurement:**
- Seasonality patterns
- Purchase cycle stage
- Urgency indicators

**Gate Pass Condition:**
```
∂Φ/∂t → 0 AND ∇²Φ ≠ 0  (stable curvature lock)
```

### Gate 6: Δ₆ — Scalar Anchor (Φ = i₀)

**Question:** Does core intent exist?

```
Φ = i₀ ∈ ℂ, dim(Φ) = 0
```

The imaginary scalar root anchors all recursion:
- Must exist for any collapse to occur
- Cannot be manufactured (it exists or doesn't)
- All field structures resolve back to this

**Measurement:**
- Latent demand existence
- Problem-solution fit
- Market need validation

**Gate Pass Condition:**
```
lim(t→0) Φ(x,t) = i₀  (field resolves to valid root)
```

---

## Part 4: The Acquisition Field Equation

### Full Gate Product

Acquisition occurs when all six gates pass:

```
f(Acquisition) = ∏ᵢ₌₁⁶ Gate_passed(Δᵢ)
```

Expanding:

```
f(Acquisition) = [|∇Φ| > θ] · [∇×F ≠ 0] · [+∇²Φ > 0] · [-∇²Φ locked] · [∂Φ/∂t → 0] · [Φ = i₀ exists]
```

### The Overlap Integral

For continuous fields:

```
Acquisition_rate = ∫∫∫ Φ_offer(x) · Ψ_demand(x) · ∏ᵢ H(Δᵢ) dx
```

Where H(Δᵢ) is the Heaviside function for gate passage.

---

## Part 5: Bridge Tensors Between Gates

### Recursive Edge Logic

Adjacent gates form **bridge tensors** encoding their interaction:

```
B̂_{Δᵢ◊Δⱼ} = ⟨T_{Δᵢ}, T_{Δⱼ}⟩
```

**Conditions:**
- B̂ = 0: No interference, recursion continues
- B̂ > 0: Resonance, accelerated collapse
- B̂ < 0: Phase conflict, recursion stall

### Critical Bridges for Acquisition

| Bridge | Gates | Meaning | Marketing Translation |
|--------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| B̂₁₂ | ∇Φ ↔ ∇×F | Push meets Memory | Awareness → Recall |
| B̂₃₄ | +∇²Φ ↔ -∇²Φ | Expansion meets Lock | Scale → Convert |
| B̂₅₆ | ∂Φ/∂t ↔ i₀ | Timing meets Intent | Launch → Need |

### Phase Conflict Detection

```
δΩⁱ◊ʲ = ‖Ωⁱ − Ωʲ‖

If δΩⁱ◊ʲ ≫ ε: Phase conflict → acquisition stalls
```

**Common Conflicts:**
- High awareness (Δ₁) but no recall (Δ₂): Impressions without memory
- Scale (Δ₃) without lock (Δ₄): Traffic without conversions
- Good timing (Δ₅) without intent (Δ₆): Launch into dead market

---

## Part 6: Field Optimization Strategy

### Maximize Overlap, Not Volume

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Maximize: Volume_in_funnel
Cost: Linear with volume
Result: 0.8% conversion (volume strategy)
```

**Field Approach:**
```
Maximize: ∫ Φ · Ψ dx
Cost: Proportional to misalignment
Result: Process only overlapping regions (precision strategy)
```

### The Targeting Equation

Optimal targeting minimizes the integral of non-overlap:

```
min ∫ |Φ(x) - Ψ(x)|² dx
```

This is equivalent to minimizing ΔΨ across the market.

### Resource Allocation Across Gates

Invest proportionally to gate weakness:

```
Investment(Δᵢ) ∝ 1 / Gate_strength(Δᵢ)
```

**Example:**
- Δ₂ (recall) weak? Invest in distinctive brand assets
- Δ₄ (lock) weak? Reduce friction in conversion path
- Δ₅ (timing) weak? Improve seasonality targeting

## Part 7: Implementation Architecture

### The Six-Gate Audit

```python
def field_acquisition_audit(market_data: MarketData) -> AuditResult:
    """
    Evaluate all six ICHTB gates for acquisition readiness.
    """

    gates = {
        'delta_1_gradient': evaluate_gradient(market_data),
        'delta_2_memory': evaluate_memory_loop(market_data),
        'delta_3_expansion': evaluate_expansion(market_data),
        'delta_4_lock': evaluate_lock(market_data),
        'delta_5_timing': evaluate_timing(market_data),
        'delta_6_intent': evaluate_intent(market_data)
    }

    # Check bridge tensors
    bridges = {
        'awareness_to_recall': bridge_tensor(gates['delta_1_gradient'], gates['delta_2_memory']),
        'scale_to_convert': bridge_tensor(gates['delta_3_expansion'], gates['delta_4_lock']),
        'timing_to_intent': bridge_tensor(gates['delta_5_timing'], gates['delta_6_intent'])
    }

    # Compute acquisition probability
    all_gates_pass = all(g > THRESHOLD for g in gates.values())
    no_conflicts = all(b >= 0 for b in bridges.values())

    acquisition_ready = all_gates_pass and no_conflicts

    return AuditResult(
        gates=gates,
        bridges=bridges,
        ready=acquisition_ready,
        weak_gates=[k for k, v in gates.items() if v < THRESHOLD]
    )
```

### Field Overlap Computation

```python
def compute_field_overlap(offer_field: Field, demand_field: Field) -> float:
    """
    ∫∫ Φ(x) · Ψ(x) dx
    """
    # Discretize fields
    offer_vector = offer_field.to_vector()
    demand_vector = demand_field.to_vector()

    # Compute overlap integral (dot product approximation)
    overlap = np.dot(offer_vector, demand_vector)

    # Normalize
    overlap_normalized = overlap / (np.linalg.norm(offer_vector) * np.linalg.norm(demand_vector))

    return overlap_normalized
```

## Part 8: Case Study Structure

### Diagnosis Framework

1. **Map offer field Φ** — What are you selling across all dimensions?
2. **Map demand field Ψ** — What does market want across all dimensions?
3. **Compute overlap** — Where do fields intersect?
4. **Audit gates** — Which Δᵢ are passing/failing?
5. **Identify conflicts** — Which bridge tensors show interference?
6. **Prescribe actions** — Invest in weak gates, resolve conflicts

### Success Metrics

## Part 9: Connection to Collapse Geometry

### Field Acquisition → Recursive Collapse

Field Acquisition determines **where** collapse is possible.
Recursive Collapse determines **whether** collapse occurs.

```
Field Acquisition: ∫ Φ · Ψ dx > 0  (overlap exists)
                        ↓
Recursive Collapse: P_collapse(x) = exp(-(ΔΨ)²/2σ²)  (collapse probability)
                        ↓
Writability Gate: W(x) = δ(Φ-Ψ) > ε  (execution permission)
                        ↓
Master Equation: f(x) = W · γᵗ · ∫(BMS/Σ)dτ  (integrated activation)
```

### The Chain

1. **Field defines region** — Where Φ ∩ Ψ ≠ ∅
2. **Gates filter eligibility** — All six Δᵢ must pass
3. **Collapse computes probability** — P(ΔΨ) per entity
4. **Writability executes** — Only writables processed
5. **Master Equation integrates** — Cumulative value over time

---

## Part 10: Summary

### The Field Acquisition Principle

> **Acquisition is not push through stages. It is alignment of fields across six recursive surfaces.**

### The Six Questions

1. **Δ₁:** Is there a pull toward us?
2. **Δ₂:** Will they remember us?
3. **Δ₃:** Is there room to expand?
4. **Δ₄:** Can we lock the conversion?
5. **Δ₅:** Is the timing right?
6. **Δ₆:** Does core intent exist?

### The Action

**Stop optimizing funnels. Start computing field overlap.**
