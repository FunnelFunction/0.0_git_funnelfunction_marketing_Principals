# 0.3.a f(Recursive_Collapse)

**Field-Based Acquisition Architecture**

*Paper in development*

---

## Core Thesis

Leads aren't "qualified" through stages—they either **collapse** into customers or they don't. The system doesn't manage stages; it computes collapse conditions.

---

## Key Equation

```
f(P_collapse) = exp(-(ΔΨ)² / 2σ²)
```

Where:
- **ΔΨ** = Gap between customer intent and offer state
- **σ** = Tolerance (how much misalignment is acceptable)

---

## Planned Content

1. Mathematical definition of collapse in customer acquisition
2. Comparison with funnel stage-gate model
3. Implementation architecture
4. Case studies

---
