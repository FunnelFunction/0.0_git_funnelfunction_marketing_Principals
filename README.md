## Repository Purpose

This is a **README of READMEs**—a living, extensible knowledge base for the mathematical foundations of sales, marketing, and autonomous business systems. Every folder contains principles, equations, and frameworks that can be referenced, extended, and composed into working systems.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Each document is a **standalone truth** that can be imported into any context
- Numbering system allows **infinite extensibility** (0.1.a.i.α if needed)
- Foundations feed into models; models feed into implementations
- No document is ever "finished"—only **versioned forward**

## The Core Thesis

### The Funnel is Dead

Traditional sales funnels are **linear loss machines**:

```
Awareness (1000) → Interest (200) → Decision (40) → Action (8)
```

Each stage bleeds 80%. This is exponential decay by design:

```
Conversion = L₀ · e^(-λn)
```

**The 4IR replacement:** Don't push leads through leaky pipes. Instead, compute which leads are **writable from the start**:

```
W(x) = δ(Φ(x) − Ψ(x)) > ε
```

Where:
- **Φ(x)** = Customer intent field
- **Ψ(x)** = Your offer state
- **ε** = Writability threshold

Only collapse on aligned states. Everything else is CPU waste.

## Extensibility Schema

To add new content:

1. **New foundation?** → `0.1.e_Your_Topic/README.md`
2. **New funnel stage detail?** → `0.2.a.iii_Your_Detail/README.md`
3. **New autonomous model?** → `0.3.e_Your_Model/README.md`
4. **Sub-sub detail?** → Use Greek: `0.1.a.i.α_Micro_Topic/README.md`

The numbering system is **infinitely extensible**. Never delete—only version forward.
