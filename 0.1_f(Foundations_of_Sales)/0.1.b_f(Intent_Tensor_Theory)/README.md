**The Field Dynamics of Business Execution**

---

## Core Equation Stack

```
Φ  →  ∇Φ  →  ∇×F  →  ∇²Φ
```

| Symbol | Meaning | Business Translation |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Φ | Intent Field | Desired outcome vector |
| ∇Φ | Gradient of Intent | Direction of pull toward goal |
| ∇×F | Curl / Memory Loop | Recursive feedback, retry logic |
| ∇²Φ | Laplacian / Collapse | Execution lock—when action becomes inevitable |

---

## f(Main_Collapse)

```
Code = ∇²Φ = f(ΔΨ, κ)
```

Where:
- **Φ** = Intent Field (the desired state vector)
- **Ψ** = Reality (actual observed state)
- **ΔΨ** = Gap between intent and state
- **κ** = Curvent (vector of execution force)
- **∇²Φ** = The point at which logic becomes inevitable

---

## f(Curvent): The Signal Vector

```
κ(t) = ∂Φ/∂x + λ·∇Φ + Σ Γ
```

A composite vector guiding execution:
- **∂Φ/∂x** = Local gradient
- **λ·∇Φ** = Global weighting
- **Σ Γ** = External gates (APIs, conditionals)

## Operator Mapping to Business Roles

| Role | Operator | Function |
|------|----------|----------|
| CEO | Φ (Core Scalar) | Seed anchor, hidden center |
| CIO | ∇Φ (Forward Collapse Surface) | Directs public flow, projects org outward |
| CHRO | ∇×F (Curl / Memory Loop) | Recruits, replaces, maintains recursive cycles |
| COO | −∇²Φ (Compression) | Grounds structure in execution |
| CFO | +∇²Φ (Expansion) | Financial diffusion / resource distribution |

---

## f(Stability)

```
Stability = Φ · (∇×F) · (CIO) · (COO ⊕ CFO)
```

- Φ (CEO) must always exist, or collapse occurs
- ∇×F (CHRO) ensures reseeding → recursion can repair
- CIO buffers outward recursion
- COO ⊕ CFO: at least one lock must hold
