0.1.h_f(Retrospective Application Hindsight): Hindsight and the Calculus of Attribution

Hindsight is the use of the Dynamic Awareness Function ($\mathcal{A}$) to isolate the causal contribution of a specific creative exposure $e$ or campaign spend $\lambda_e$ to the final purchase event. This requires decomposing the overall outcome using the chain rule, effectively removing the noise and load variables ($\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{L}$) from the attribution calculation.

1. The Marginal Revenue Contribution (MRC)

The ultimate goal of Hindsight is to calculate the Marginal Revenue Contribution (MRC) of an exposure $\lambda_e$ on the final purchase probability $P(\text{Purchase})$.

We define the purchase probability as a logistic function of the Integrated Activation Trace $I$ and other factors $F$:

$$P(\text{Purchase}) = \sigma(\eta_1 I + F)$$

The marginal contribution is calculated using the chain rule, decomposing the total effect into three causal links:

$$\text{MRC}_{\lambda_e} = \frac{\partial P(\text{Purchase})}{\partial \lambda_e} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial I} \cdot \frac{\partial I}{\partial \mathcal{A}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e}$$

1.1. Decomposing the Attribution Chain

Link 1: Purchase Probability Sensitivity ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial I}$)

This measures how sensitive the final purchase probability is to the state of the memory trace. This is the partial derivative of the logistic function:

$$\frac{\partial P}{\partial I} = \eta_1 \cdot P(\text{Purchase}) \cdot (1 - P(\text{Purchase}))$$

Interpretation: Sensitivity is highest when $P(\text{Purchase})$ is near $0.5$ (the tipping point) and approaches zero at the extremes (already loyal or completely disinterested).

Link 2: Trace Sensitivity to Awareness ($\frac{\partial I}{\partial \mathcal{A}}$)

This link is dictated by the memory decay $\gamma$. In the discrete-time model:

$$\frac{\partial I}{\partial \mathcal{A}} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}$$

Interpretation: A more durable memory trace ($\gamma \to 1$) means the awareness input $\mathcal{A}$ has a greater long-term impact on $I$.

Link 3: Awareness Sensitivity to Exposure ($\frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e}$)

This isolates the controllable impact of the Marketer's action ($\lambda_e$) on $\mathcal{A}$. Since $\lambda_e$ influences $\mathbf{S}$, the dependency is on the Sensory Strength sub-function.

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \mathbf{S}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial \lambda_e}$$

2. Counterfactual Attribution (The Isolation of Noise)

The primary power of Hindsight is its ability to compute the counterfactual: What was the outcome if the uncontrollable variables ($\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{L}$) had been different?

Attribution of success is assigned to the Marketer's action $\lambda_e$ and the Receiver's high internal state $\mathbf{\Pi}$ (Soul) via Shapley Value Attribution over the numerator terms:

$$\text{Attribution}(\lambda_e) \propto \text{ShapleyValue}(\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{\Pi})$$

This method ensures that the creative's success is rated based on its intrinsic strength ($\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{\Pi}$) and not confounded by the fact that the user happened to be in a low-noise ($\mathbf{N} \downarrow$) or low-load ($\mathbf{L} \downarrow$) environment. The Gating Function is the causal map required for this decomposition.
