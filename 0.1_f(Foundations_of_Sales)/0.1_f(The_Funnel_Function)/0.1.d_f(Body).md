0.1.d_f(Body): The Calculus of Sensory Strength and Physical Constraints ($\mathbf{S}$)

The Body component ($\mathbf{S}$) quantifies the signal's ability to overcome the non-negotiable physical and biological constraints of the Receiver's sensory apparatus. It is the measure of the signal's survival probability based on fundamental psychophysics.

1. Defining the Sensory Strength Weight ($\mathbf{S}$)

The Sensory Strength $\mathbf{S}$ is modeled as a product of factors related to physical exposure, following Signal Detection Theory (SDT). It must exceed a minimum threshold $T_{\text{min}}$ to even enter the Gating Function numerator.

$$\mathbf{S} = f(\text{Contrast}, \text{Duration}, \text{Size}) \cdot \mathbb{I}(\mathbf{S} > T_{\text{min}})$$

Where:

$f$: A multidimensional efficacy function.

$T_{\text{min}}$: The absolute threshold for detection (e.g., $50 \text{ms}$ fixation duration, $2\%$ change in contrast).

$\mathbb{I}$: The indicator function, ensuring $\mathbf{S}$ immediately collapses to $0$ if any physical requirement is unmet.

The Multiplicative Gating Effect: If $\mathbf{S} \to 0$, the entire awareness function collapses: $\mathcal{A} \to 0$. The Marketer must first satisfy the constraints imposed by Body before Mind or Soul can be engaged.

2. Sender's Perspective: Foresight (Optimization)

The Sender optimizes $\mathbf{S}$ by investing in premium placement, higher-contrast creative, and longer dwell times. This is the Resource Allocation Problem for guaranteeing sensory survival.

2.1. Minimizing Sensory Failure Risk

The Marketer seeks to allocate budget $\lambda_s$ (spend on guaranteed visibility) to minimize the probability of sensory collapse $P(\mathbf{S} \le T_{\text{min}})$.

$$\min_{\lambda_s} \; P(\mathbf{S} \le T_{\text{min}} \mid \lambda_s)$$

This is a stochastic constraint problem. The budget is not spent to maximize $\mathbf{S}$ beyond a certain point, but to guarantee a minimum $\mathbf{S}_{\text{guaranteed}}$ where $P(\mathbf{S} \le T_{\text{min}})$ approaches zero. After this point, investment should shift to $\mathbf{R}$ or $\mathbf{\Pi}$.

2.2. Marginal Gain on Sensory Spend

The Marginal Awareness Return (MAR) of increasing sensory spend $\lambda_s$ is highly non-linear, exhibiting diminishing returns after the guarantee threshold is met:

$$\text{MAR}_S = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \mathbf{S}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial \lambda_s} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}}{\mathbf{N} + \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{\Theta}} \right) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial \lambda_s}$$

Strategic Calculus: Foresight dictates that the denominator's effect is crucial: in high-noise environments ($\mathbf{N} \uparrow$), a greater $\mathbf{S}$ is required to simply achieve the same baseline $\mathcal{A}$, making Body investment a defensive strategy against competition.

3. Receiver's Perspective: Hindsight (Attribution)

Hindsight audits the effectiveness of physical spend by isolating $\mathbf{S}$'s contribution to awareness, regardless of creative quality ($\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{\Pi}$).

3.1. S's Role in Awareness Generation

The exposure's ability to physically break through the sensory gate is measured by the integral of the $\mathcal{A}$ function weighted by $\mathbf{S}$.

For a single user $u$ at time $t$, the causal contribution of Body ($\mathbf{S}$) to the instantaneous activation $\mathcal{A}$ is:

$$\text{Contribution}_{\mathbf{S}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \mathbf{S}} = \frac{\mathbf{R}_{u,m,t} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}_{u,m,t}}{\mathbf{N}_{m,t} + \mathbf{L}_{u,t} + \mathbf{\Theta}_{u}}$$

Audit Implication: If a campaign's overall performance was poor, but $\text{Contribution}_{\mathbf{S}}$ was high (meaning the signal was physically present and strong), the failure is likely attributable to low $\mathbf{R}$ (poor targeting/relevance) or low $\mathbf{\Pi}$ (poor creative resonance).

3.2. Decomposing Body from Environmental Luck

Just as with Mind, Hindsight uses Shapley Value Attribution over the numerator to divorce the impact of $\mathbf{S}$ from the contribution of $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{\Pi}$. The Body's success is defined purely by its ability to fulfill the physical prerequisite.

$$\text{Attribution}_{\mathbf{S}} = \text{ShapleyValue}(\mathbf{S} \mid \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{\Pi})$$

This counterfactual ensures that the physical visibility of the ad is fairly credited for the resulting activation, enabling the Marketer to audit the media buy quality independently of the creative's content
