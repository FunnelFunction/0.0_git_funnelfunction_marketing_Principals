0.1.c_f(Mind): The Calculus of Relevance and Prediction Error ($\mathbf{R}$)

The Mind component ($\mathbf{R}$) quantifies the cognitive efficiency of the signal. It operates under the neuroscientific principle of Prediction Error: an organism only allocates attention to stimuli that violate its prior expectations. Low relevance (high predictability) results in $\mathbf{R} \to 0$, causing a multiplicative collapse of the entire Gating Function $\mathcal{A}$.

1. Defining the Relevance Weight ($\mathbf{R}$)

The Relevance Weight $\mathbf{R}$ is defined as a non-linear function of the discrepancy between the user's prior expectation of the ad content ($E_{u,m}$) and the actual content stimulus ($S_{e}$), conditioned by the perceived precision of the user's expectation ($\mathcal{P}$).

$$\mathbf{R}(S_e, E_{u,m}, \mathcal{P}) = f \left( \frac{ | S_e - E_{u,m} | }{\mathcal{P}} \right)$$

Where:

$| S_e - E_{u,m} |$: The magnitude of the Prediction Error (surprise).

$\mathcal{P}$: Precision of the prior—how certain the user is of their expectation. A low $\mathcal{P}$ means the user is unsure, so less surprise is needed for a high $\mathbf{R}$.

The Gating Effect: Since $\mathbf{R}$ is in the numerator, it serves as the crucial cognitive filter. When $S_e \approx E_{u,m}$ (no surprise), $\mathbf{R} \to 0$, and $\mathcal{A} \to 0$, regardless of the spend ($\mathbf{S}$) or the Noise ($\mathbf{N}$).

2. Sender's Perspective: Foresight (Optimization)

The Sender's goal is to maximize $\mathbf{R}$ through precise targeting and creative sequencing. This is a problem of minimizing expected prediction error while ensuring sufficient surprise.

2.1. Expected Awareness Maximization

The Marketer optimizes ad choice $e$ over a set of target users $\mathcal{U}$ to maximize the expected Relevance Weight:

$$\max_{e} \; \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{U}} [ \mathbf{R}(e) ]$$

This requires a user-specific utility function that maps attributes $\mathbf{x}_u$ to the content expectation $E_{u,m}$. The optimal creative $e^*$ is one that is sufficiently surprising to the largest segment of $\mathcal{U}$, without being so unfamiliar that the Body or Soul components fail.

2.2. Marginal Gain on Relevance Spend

If $\lambda_r$ is the cost (spend) associated with improving targeting precision (increasing $\mathbf{R}$), the Marginal Awareness Return (MAR) is given by:

$$\text{MAR}_R = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{R}}{\partial \lambda_r} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}}{\mathbf{N} + \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{\Theta}} \right) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{R}}{\partial \lambda_r}$$

Strategic Calculus: Foresight dictates that investment $\lambda_r$ is most efficient when $\mathbf{S}$ (Body) and $\mathbf{\Pi}$ (Soul) are already high, amplifying the Mind's contribution.

3. Receiver's Perspective: Hindsight (Attribution)

Hindsight applies the calculus to past performance to audit the effectiveness of targeting—isolating $\mathbf{R}$'s contribution to revenue, independently of environmental luck ($\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{L}$).

3.1. R's Contribution to Marginal Revenue (MRC)

From the Canvas file, the overall Marginal Revenue Contribution of an exposure is:

$$\text{MRC}_{\lambda_e} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial I} \cdot \frac{\partial I}{\partial \mathcal{A}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e}$$

The unique contribution of $\mathbf{R}$ to the $\frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e}$ term is isolated via the chain rule on the numerator $\mathcal{N} = \mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}$:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{N} + \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{\Theta}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{N}}{\partial \lambda_e}$$

3.2. Decomposing Mind vs. Body Contribution

To isolate the value of targeting ($\mathbf{R}$) from the value of sensory quality ($\mathbf{S}$), we use Shapley Value Attribution over the numerator terms:

$$\text{Attribution}_{\mathbf{R}} = \text{ShapleyValue}(\mathbf{R} \mid \mathbf{S}, \mathbf{\Pi})$$

This counterfactual process measures the average marginal increase in $\mathcal{A}$ contributed by $\mathbf{R}$ across all possible combinations of $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{\Pi}$. This is the only way to accurately audit the targeting algorithm's performance, removing confounding factors.

Hindsight Interpretation: If a high purchase conversion occurred, the $\mathbf{R}$ attribution is high only if the ad was shown to a high-relevance user ($\mathbf{R} \uparrow$) who was simultaneously in a low-noise environment ($\mathbf{N} \downarrow$). The Shapley value isolates and credits only the $\mathbf{R}$ component's intrinsic strength.
