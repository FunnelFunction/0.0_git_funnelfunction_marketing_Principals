0.1.c_f(Mind): The Calculus of Relevance and Prediction Error ($\mathbf{R}$)

The Mind component ($\mathbf{R}$) quantifies the cognitive efficiency of the signal. It operates under the neuroscientific principle of Prediction Error: an organism only allocates attention to stimuli that violate its prior expectations. Low relevance (high predictability) results in $\mathbf{R} \to 0$, causing a multiplicative collapse of the entire Gating Function $\mathcal{A}$.

1. Defining the Relevance Weight ($\mathbf{R}$)

The Relevance Weight $\mathbf{R}$ is defined as a non-linear function of the discrepancy between the user's prior expectation of the ad content ($E_{u,m}$) and the actual content stimulus ($S_{e}$), conditioned by the perceived precision of the user's expectation ($\mathcal{P}$).

$$\mathbf{R}(S_e, E_{u,m}, \mathcal{P}) = f \left( \frac{ | S_e - E_{u,m} | }{\mathcal{P}} \right)$$

Where:

$| S_e - E_{u,m} |$: The magnitude of the Prediction Error (surprise).

$\mathcal{P}$: Precision of the prior—how certain the user is of their expectation. A low $\mathcal{P}$ means the user is unsure, so less surprise is needed for a high $\mathbf{R}$.

The Gating Effect: Since $\mathbf{R}$ is in the numerator, it serves as the crucial cognitive filter. When $S_e \approx E_{u,m}$ (no surprise), $\mathbf{R} \to 0$, and $\mathcal{A} \to 0$, regardless of the spend ($\mathbf{S}$) or the Noise ($\mathbf{N}$).

2. Sender's Perspective: Foresight (Optimization)

The Sender's goal is to maximize $\mathbf{R}$ through precise targeting and creative sequencing. This is a problem of minimizing expected prediction error while ensuring sufficient surprise.

2.1. Expected Awareness Maximization

The Marketer optimizes ad choice $e$ over a set of target users $\mathcal{U}$ to maximize the expected Relevance Weight:

$$\max_{e} \; \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{U}} [ \mathbf{R}(e) ]$$

This requires a user-specific utility function that maps attributes $\mathbf{x}_u$ to the content expectation $E_{u,m}$. The optimal creative $e^*$ is one that is sufficiently surprising to the largest segment of $\mathcal{U}$, without being so unfamiliar that the Body or Soul components fail.

2.2. Marginal Gain on Relevance Spend

If $\lambda_r$ is the cost (spend) associated with improving targeting precision (increasing $\mathbf{R}$), the Marginal Awareness Return (MAR) is given by:

$$\text{MAR}_R = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{R}}{\partial \lambda_r} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}}{\mathbf{N} + \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{\Theta}} \right) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{R}}{\partial \lambda_r}$$

Strategic Calculus: Foresight dictates that investment $\lambda_r$ is most efficient when $\mathbf{S}$ (Body) and $\mathbf{\Pi}$ (Soul) are already high, amplifying the Mind's contribution.

3. Receiver's Perspective: Hindsight (Attribution)

Hindsight applies the calculus to past performance to audit the effectiveness of targeting—isolating $\mathbf{R}$'s contribution to revenue, independently of environmental luck ($\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{L}$).

3.1. R's Contribution to Marginal Revenue (MRC)

From the Canvas file, the overall Marginal Revenue Contribution of an exposure is:

$$\text{MRC}_{\lambda_e} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial I} \cdot \frac{\partial I}{\partial \mathcal{A}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e}$$

The unique contribution of $\mathbf{R}$ to the $\frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e}$ term is isolated via the chain rule on the numerator $\mathcal{N} = \mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}$:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \lambda_e} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{N} + \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{\Theta}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{N}}{\partial \lambda_e}$$

3.2. Decomposing Mind vs. Body Contribution

To isolate the value of targeting ($\mathbf{R}$) from the value of sensory quality ($\mathbf{S}$), we use Shapley Value Attribution over the numerator terms:

$$\text{Attribution}_{\mathbf{R}} = \text{ShapleyValue}(\mathbf{R} \mid \mathbf{S}, \mathbf{\Pi})$$

This counterfactual process measures the average marginal increase in $\mathcal{A}$ contributed by $\mathbf{R}$ across all possible combinations of $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{\Pi}$. This is the only way to accurately audit the targeting algorithm's performance, removing confounding factors.

Mind Driver: $\mathbf{M}(\tau)$ - Relevance and Mental Availability

I. Conceptual Thesis: The Cognitive Match

The Mind driver ($\mathbf{M}$) quantifies the system's preparedness to receive the brand's message. It operationalizes Mental Availability—the extent to which the brand is recalled in relevant buying situations (Category Entry Points, or CEPs). High $\mathbf{M}$ means low cognitive effort is required to link the stimulus to a need.

The framework is driven by Relevance (Mental Market Share) and Distinctiveness (Prediction Error).

II. Operational Metrics and Standards

This operationalization maps the Mind framework to Ehrenberg-Bass principles, emphasizing the structure of the mental links:

Mind Driver

The relevance weight ($\mathbf{M} \ge 0$) applied to the encoded stimulus, indicating the potential for retrieval in a buying context.

A multiplier that scales the awareness potential.

$M_{\text{MMS}}$

Mental Market Share

The proportion of total Category Entry Points (CEPs) for the category that the brand is successfully linked to in the target consumer's mind.

Measures baseline mental availability (relevance).

$D_{\text{score}}$

Distinctiveness Score

A measure of how quickly and uniquely the brand's assets (logo, colors, tone, character) are identified by the user, minimizing prediction error.

Measures the efficiency of retrieval.

$\lambda$

Prediction Error Coefficient

An empirically derived constant that calibrates the marginal gain (boost) achieved by increasing distinctiveness on top of relevance, based on commercial outcomes.

Weights the impact of distinctiveness on overall relevance.

$(1 + \lambda \cdot D_{\text{score}})$

Distinctiveness Multiplier

The boost factor, where unique, recognizable assets increase the overall relevance weight $\mathbf{M}$.

Reflects the finding that distinctiveness acts as an accelerant to relevance.

3. The Soul Driver ($\mathbf{S}$)

Hindsight Interpretation: If a high purchase conversion occurred, the $\mathbf{R}$ attribution is high only if the ad was shown to a high-relevance user ($\mathbf{R} \uparrow$) who was simultaneously in a low-noise environment ($\mathbf{N} \downarrow$). The Shapley value isolates and credits only the $\mathbf{R}$ component's intrinsic strength.
