0.1.f_f(Point of View): Point of View and the Dual-Layer Calculus

The mathematical utility of the Dynamic Awareness Function ($\mathcal{A}$) is defined by the perspective from which it is viewed. The Sender manipulates inputs to maximize $\mathcal{A}$; the Receiver's response is the probabilistic outcome of $\mathcal{A}$.

$$\mathcal{A}_{u,m,t}(e) = \frac{ \mathbf{S}_{u,m,t} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{u,m,t} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}_{u,m,t} }{ \mathbf{N}_{m,t} + \mathbf{L}_{u,t} + \mathbf{\Theta}_{u} }$$

1. The Sender’s Calculus (The Maximization Problem)

The Marketer (Sender) controls only a subset of the numerator factors (creative quality, spend, placement) and, through placement, influences $\mathbf{N}$. The Sender’s calculus is an Optimization Problem—maximizing the Marginal Awareness Return (MAR) for every unit of cost $\lambda_c$.

1.1. Controllable Levers and Partial Derivatives

The most direct mathematical application is to quantify the sensitivity of $\mathcal{A}$ to the controllable variables: $\mathbf{S}$ (Sensory Spend/Quality), $\mathbf{R}$ (Relevance/Targeting), and $\mathbf{\Pi}$ (Creative Resonance/Soul).

The Marginal Awareness Return (MAR) of increasing Resonance ($\mathbf{\Pi}$) is given by the partial derivative:

$$\text{MAR}_{\Pi} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A}}{\partial \mathbf{\Pi}} = \frac{\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{R}}{ \mathbf{N} + \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{\Theta} }$$

Interpretation: The MAR is multiplicative. A high $\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{R}$ means that every incremental increase in Soul ($\mathbf{\Pi}$) yields an increasingly high return, especially when the denominator (Competition) is low.

1.2. The Optimization Constraint (The Dual Maximization)

The Marketer seeks to find the optimal ratio of investment in Body ($\mathbf{S}$) and Soul ($\mathbf{\Pi}$) to maximize $\mathcal{A}$ subject to a budget constraint $B$.

$$\max \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{\Pi}) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad C(\mathbf{S}) + C(\mathbf{\Pi}) \le B$$

This requires solving for the point where the ratio of marginal awareness returns equals the ratio of marginal costs:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{A} / \partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial C / \partial \mathbf{S}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{A} / \partial \mathbf{\Pi}}{\partial C / \partial \mathbf{\Pi}}$$

2. The Receiver’s Calculus (The Stochastic Experience)

The User (Receiver) experiences $\mathcal{A}$ not as a fixed value, but as a point sampled from a probabilistic distribution $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{A})$, where the mean and variance are conditioned on their instantaneous $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{N}$.

2.1. The Awareness Probability Density Function (PDF)

The Receiver’s internal process is modeled by the probability density function $f(\mathcal{A})$ of the Activation score. The probability of an ad igniting is the integral of $f(\mathcal{A})$ above the threshold $\mathbf{\Theta}$:

$$P(\text{Ignition}) = \int_{\mathbf{\Theta}}^{\infty} f(\mathcal{A} \mid \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{N}) \, d\mathcal{A}$$

Key Insight: Since $\mathbf{L}$ (Load) and $\mathbf{N}$ (Noise) are the primary determinants of the density function's parameters, the Receiver mathematically proves the strategic rule: The Marketer must minimize $N$ and $L$ to shift the probability mass $f(\mathcal{A})$ above the required ignition threshold $\mathbf{\Theta}$.

2.2. The Differential of Attention

From the Receiver's perspective, attention is the rate of change of the integrated activation trace $I$ over time $t$. This is the continuous-time version of the Adstock model, where the instantaneous input is $\mathcal{A}$.

$$\frac{dI_{u,b,t}}{dt} = - \lambda_{decay} I_{u,b,t} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{A}_{u,m,t}(e)$$

where $\lambda_{decay}$ is the exponential decay rate of memory, and $\beta$ is the encoding efficacy. The user's awareness is fundamentally defined by the stability of this differential equation, which is constantly being perturbed by incoming $\mathcal{A}$ signals.
