# f(Mediums) — A Scientific History of Communication Mediums

> **From Cave Paintings to Digital Networks: 45,000 Years of Attention Architecture**

---

## Abstract

Human communication technology has evolved through five major paradigm shifts—from speech to writing, printing, electronic transmission, and digital networks—each fundamentally restructuring how societies store, transmit, and process information. This document synthesizes the scholarly consensus across media studies, archaeology, and communication theory to provide an academic foundation for understanding how mediums emerge, why they succeed, and when they become monetized for attention.

**Key Insight**: Herbert Simon's 1971 observation remains the central axiom: *"A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."* Every advertising business model since ancient town criers has been fundamentally about capturing, measuring, and monetizing the scarce resource of human attention.

## 1. The Academic Discipline

The formal study of communication media falls under several overlapping fields:

| Field | Focus | Key Figures |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Media Studies** | Broadest interdisciplinary umbrella | McLuhan, Postman, Ong |
| **Communication Studies** | Transmission processes | Shannon, Lasswell, Schramm |
| **Media Ecology** | Media as environments | Postman, Strate, Levinson |
| **Medium Theory** | How form shapes content | Innis, McLuhan, Meyrowitz |

### 1.1 The Toronto School (1940s-1960s)

**Harold Innis** (1894-1952) pioneered the concept of communication "bias":

- **Time-biased media**: Durable materials (stone, oral tradition) → favor continuity, religion, decentralized authority
- **Space-biased media**: Portable materials (paper, electronics) → favor territorial expansion, centralized administration

> *"Civilizational stability requires equilibrium between time-bias and space-bias."*
> — Innis, *The Bias of Communication* (1951)

**Marshall McLuhan** (1911-1980) transformed these ideas into cultural touchstones:

- **"The medium is the message"** — Form shapes perception more than content
- **"Hot and cool media"** — High-definition (low participation) vs. low-definition (high engagement)
- **"Global village"** — Electronic media collapsing space and time

Key works:
- *The Gutenberg Galaxy* (1962)
- *Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man* (1964)

### 1.2 Media Ecology (1971-present)

**Neil Postman** formalized Media Ecology at NYU in 1971:

> *"Media ecology is the study of media as environments—how technology and communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value."*

His *Amusing Ourselves to Death* (1985) argued television transforms public discourse into entertainment—a thesis many consider prophetic for social media.

### 1.3 Information Theory

**Claude Shannon's** *Mathematical Theory of Communication* (1948-1949) provided the quantitative foundation:

- Information entropy
- Channel capacity
- Signal-to-noise ratios

This enables mathematical modeling of communication systems—directly relevant to f(x).

## 2. The First Medium Ever Recorded

### 2.1 Speech: The Original Medium

**Spoken language** emerged approximately **100,000-500,000 BCE**—humanity's first communication medium.

Limitation: No permanent record, geographic constraints, generational information loss.

### 2.2 Cave Paintings: First Permanent Records

| Site | Date | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Sulawesi, Indonesia | ~45,500 years ago | Oldest known figurative art (pig) |
| La Pasiega, Spain | ~64,000-66,700 years ago | Possibly Neanderthal-created |
| Chauvet, France | ~37,000-28,000 BCE | Complex artistic composition |
| Lascaux, France | ~17,000-15,000 BCE | ~2,000 figures |

**Key insight**: Humans have been inscribing permanent symbols for attention and transmission for at least **45 millennia**.

## 3. Chronological Evolution

### 3.1 Pre-Literate Era (180,000-3500 BCE)

For ~150,000 years, **oral tradition** served as primary information storage.

**Clay tokens** (8000-3000 BCE) represent the direct ancestor of writing:
- Geometric shapes tracking agricultural surplus
- One-to-one correspondence with goods
- By 3500 BCE: impressions on clay envelopes → first written signs

**Problem solved**: Managing surplus economy of Neolithic agricultural societies.

### 3.2 Writing Systems (3500-800 BCE)

#### Cuneiform (~3200 BCE, Sumer)

- Invented for **accounting, not literature**
- Only after 2600 BCE: phonetic signs and literary uses
- *Epic of Gilgamesh* (~2500 BCE): first recorded narrative

#### Egyptian Hieroglyphics (~3200 BCE)

- ~1,000 ideograms, phonograms, determinatives
- 24 uniliteral signs (potential alphabet, never developed)

#### Phoenician Alphabet (~1500-1100 BCE)

- **22 consonantal signs** via acrophony
- Democratized literacy (vs. hundreds of cuneiform signs)
- Spread by maritime traders

#### Greek Alphabet (~800-750 BCE)

- Added **vowels** → first complete phonetic representation
- Parent of Latin, Cyrillic, most Western alphabets

**Problems solved**: Permanent transaction records, immortalizing rulers/texts, administering empires.

### 3.3 Print Revolution (1040-1833 CE)

#### Early Movable Type

| Innovation | Date | Location |
|------------|------|----------|
| Movable ceramic type | ~1040 CE | China (Bi Sheng) |
| Metal movable type | 1234 | Korea |
| *Jikji* (oldest metal-type book) | 1377 | Korea |

#### Gutenberg (~1440-1455)

Four combined elements:
1. Lead-tin-antimony alloy (low melting point)
2. Oil-based ink (adheres to metal)
3. Hand mould (rapid type production)
4. Adapted wine press

**Result**: 40 hand-copied pages/day → **3,600 pages/workday**

**Impact**:
- 8-24 million books within 50 years
- 2,500+ print-houses by 1499
- English literacy: 20% (14th c.) → 47% (1696)
- Enabled: Protestant Reformation, Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment

#### First Newspapers

## 4. When Categories Emerged

Categories are **retroactive constructions**—they emerge only when new technologies require distinctions.

| Term | Coined | Trigger |
|------|--------|---------|
| **"Mass media"** | 1923 | Nationwide radio networks |
| **"Media"** (modern sense) | 1954 | McLuhan's *Counterblast* |
| **"Print media"** | 1920s-1950s | Distinction from electronic |
| **"Broadcast media"** | Early 1920s | Radio engineers (Midwest U.S.) |
| **"New media"** | 1990s | Internet emergence |
| **"Social media"** | 1994-1997 | Darrell Berry (1994), Ted Leonsis (1997) |

**Lasswell's Communication Model** (1948):

> *"Who says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect?"*

Perhaps mass communication's oldest concept not borrowed from another discipline.

## 6. Key Paradigm Shifts

Every successful new medium solves one of three problems:

1. **Permanence** — Making information survive
2. **Speed** — Making information travel faster
3. **Access** — Making information reach more people

| Shift | Year | Transformation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Writing | ~3200 BCE | **Permanence**: Knowledge survives beyond memory |
| Alphabet | ~1100 BCE | **Access**: Literacy no longer requires years of training |
| Printing | 1455 | **Scale**: Mass reproduction replaces hand-copying |
| Penny Press | 1833 | **Access**: News affordable for masses |
| Telegraph | 1844 | **Speed**: Communication separated from transportation |
| Radio | 1920 | **Simultaneity**: Millions receive identical content at once |
| Television | 1941/1960 | **Immersion**: Visual dimension transforms culture |
| Internet | 1983/1989 | **Interactivity**: Many-to-many replaces one-to-many |
| Smartphone | 2007 | **Ubiquity**: Connected computing becomes portable |

## 7. Implications for f(x)

### 7.1 Medium as Variable

McLuhan's thesis—"the medium is the message"—suggests mathematical models must incorporate **medium-specific parameters independent of content**.

Innis's framework offers one quantifiable dimension:
- **Time-binding coefficient**: Durability, permanence
- **Space-binding coefficient**: Reach, distribution speed

Shannon's information theory provides another:
- **Channel capacity**: Maximum information transmission rate
- **Noise ratio**: Signal degradation in medium

### 7.2 Attention Economics

Every medium creates a new **attention marketplace**. The f(x) framework must account for:

- **N (Environmental Noise)**: Varies dramatically by medium
  - TikTok ≈ 28 competing signals
  - YouTube ≈ 12
  - TV ≈ 4
  - Print ≈ 2

- **Temporal dynamics**: How quickly attention decays per medium

- **Writability (W)**: Medium affects how "writable" a user is
  - Immersive mediums (VR, cinema) → higher writability
  - Distracted mediums (social feeds) → lower writability per exposure

### 7.3 Historical Pattern

The 45,000-year arc reveals:

1. **New mediums don't replace old ones**—they layer (oral → written → print → electronic → digital all coexist)

2. **Monetization follows standardization**—advertising models emerge only after mediums mature

3. **Attention scarcity is the constant**—from cave paintings competing for tribal attention to TikTok competing for Gen Z attention, the fundamental constraint is human cognitive bandwidth
