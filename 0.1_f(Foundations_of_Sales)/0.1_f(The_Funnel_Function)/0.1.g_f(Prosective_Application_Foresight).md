0.1.g_f(Prosective Application Foresight): Foresight and the Calculus of Dynamic Planning

Foresight is the application of the Dynamic Awareness Function ($\mathcal{A}$) to optimize future resource allocation ($x_{m,t}$) subject to the budget constraint $B$. This is a computational planning problem that minimizes expected entropy while maximizing return on investment (ROI).

1. The Integrated Activation Trace ($I$)

The primary planning target is the Integrated Activation Trace ($I_{u,b,t}$), which is the cumulative, decaying memory trace of all past awareness events for brand $b$ and user $u$. This is the variable that drives purchase probability.

The trace is modeled as a summation over the campaign horizon $T$, discounting past awareness by the memory decay factor $\gamma$:

$$I_{u,b,T} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^{T-t} \cdot \mathcal{A}_{u,m,t}(e_t)$$

1.1. Predicting Stochastic Inputs

Foresight requires predicting the uncontrollable factors that will define the competition:

Environmental Noise ($\mathbf{N}_{m,t}$): Modeled as a time series forecast (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet model) based on historical intensity $\lambda_{m,t}$ in medium $m$.


$$\hat{\mathbf{N}}_{m,t} = \text{Forecast}(\mathbf{N}_{m, \tau} \mid \tau < t) + \epsilon_{t}$$

Cognitive Load ($\mathbf{L}_{u,t}$): Estimated by modeling user behavior (e.g., probability of multitasking during prime consumption hours).


$$\hat{\mathbf{L}}_{u,t} \sim \text{Conditional Distribution}(\mathbf{L} \mid \text{Time of Day}, \text{Day of Week})$$

2. Resource Allocation via Lagrangian Optimization

The Marketer seeks to maximize the expected value of the Integrated Activation Trace $\mathbb{E}[I_{u,b,T}]$ subject to the total budget constraint $B$.

$$\max_{\{x_{m,t}\}} \; \mathbb{E}[I_{u,b,T}] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \sum_{m,t} x_{m,t} \le B$$

This is solved using the Lagrangian Multiplier $\lambda_{\text{budget}}$, which represents the marginal benefit of an extra dollar spent.

$$\mathcal{L}(x_{m,t}, \lambda_{\text{budget}}) = \mathbb{E}[I_{u,b,T}] - \lambda_{\text{budget}} \left( \sum_{m,t} x_{m,t} - B \right)$$

The optimal budget allocation occurs when the partial derivative with respect to each medium's spend $x_{m,t}$ equals zero:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_{m,t}} = \frac{\partial \mathbb{E}[I_{u,b,T}]}{\partial x_{m,t}} - \lambda_{\text{budget}} = 0$$

Strategic Implication: The optimal spending $x_{m,t}$ across all mediums and time points must satisfy the condition that the Marginal Return on Integrated Activation is constant and equal to the Lagrangian Multiplier.
