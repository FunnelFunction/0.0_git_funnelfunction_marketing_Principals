# 0.1.c f(Collapse_Geometry)

**When Execution Becomes Inevitable**

---

## Core Principle

```
Code ≠ written logic
Code = permissioned collapse
```

Execution is not forced—it is **permitted** when intent aligns with state.

---

## f(Collapse)

```
Code = ∇²Φ = f(ΔΨ, κ)
```

The Laplacian (∇²Φ) represents the point at which logic becomes **inevitable**—not optional.

## Sub-Equations

| Name | Equation | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| f(Writability) | W(x) = δ(Φ(x) − Ψ(x)) > ε | Only rows where intent-state delta exceeds ε are writable |
| f(Curvent) | κ(t) = ∂Φ/∂x + λ·∇Φ + Σ Γ | Guides logic vector using local, global, and external forces |
| f(Collapse_Probability) | P(x) = e^{-(ΔΨ)² / 2σ²} / √(2πσ²) | Gaussian probability that execution should proceed |
| f(Drift) | D = ∇Ψ / ∇Φ | Schema drift or logic misalignment measure |
| f(Retry) | R = lim_{n→k} ∇×(Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψ_k) | Retry logic as rotational convergence |

## Binary vs Gaussian Collapse

### f(Binary_Collapse): ΔΨ = 0

```javascript
if (email && recipient && !timestamp) send();
```

- Executes only if reality matches intent **exactly**
- No tolerance. No retry.
- Use in: medical, legal, regulatory systems

### f(Gaussian_Collapse): ΔΨ < ε

```javascript
if (score > 0.5) send();
```

- Probability model allows soft execution criteria
- Use in: AI-preference workflows, feedback loops

## GlyphMap Translation

| GlyphMath | Collapse Geometry | Classical Math |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Φ | Scalar Intent | Target function |
| ∇Φ | Collapse gradient | Gradient descent |
| ∇×F | Recursive loop | Curl, memory flow |
| ∇²Φ | Curvature lock | Laplacian, execution |
| D = ∇Ψ/∇Φ | Drift Quotient | Alignment ratio |

---

## Implications

1. **Execution is permitted, not forced**
2. **Drift is detected and corrected before action**
3. **Writability governs energy expenditure**
4. **Logs become field-snapshots, not afterthoughts**
