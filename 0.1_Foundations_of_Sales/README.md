# 0.1 Foundations of Sales

**The Mathematical Bedrock**

This section contains the universal principles and mathematical frameworks that underpin all sales, marketing, and business automation systems. These are not tactics—they are the **physics** of commercial interaction.

---

## Philosophy

Every framework in this section must satisfy three criteria:

1. **Mathematical Rigor** — Expressed in equations, not just words
2. **Operational Validity** — Can be implemented in code
3. **Composability** — Can be combined with other foundations

## Contents

| Folder | Topic | Core Equation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| [0.1.a](./0.1.a_Autonomous_Decision_Systems/) | Autonomous Decision Systems | `V*(s) = max_a [R(s,a) + γ Σ P(s'|s,a) V*(s')]` |
| [0.1.b](./0.1.b_Intent_Tensor_Theory/) | Intent Tensor Theory | `Φ → ∇Φ → ∇×F → ∇²Φ` |
| [0.1.c](./0.1.c_Collapse_Geometry/) | Collapse Geometry | `Code = ∇²Φ = f(ΔΨ, κ)` |
| [0.1.d](./0.1.d_Writables_Doctrine/) | Writables Doctrine | `W(x) = δ(Φ(x) − Ψ(x)) > ε` |

## The Hierarchy

```
Autonomous Decision Systems    ← How machines learn optimal actions
         ↓
Intent Tensor Theory           ← How intent flows through systems
         ↓
Collapse Geometry              ← When execution becomes inevitable
         ↓
Writables Doctrine             ← What qualifies for action
```

Each layer builds on the one above. Together they form a complete replacement for human decision-making in business systems.

## Adding New Foundations

To add a new foundational principle:

1. Create folder: `0.1.e_Your_Foundation/`
2. Add `README.md` with:
   - Core equation
   - Plain meaning
   - Connection to other foundations
   - Implementation notes
3. Update this index
