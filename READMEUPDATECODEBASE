THE HARDCORE PLAN: Funnel Function → World Scientific Standard
Principle: EXPAND EVERYTHING. REDUCE NOTHING. MAKE BOLD CLAIMS DEFENSIBLE.

What You Already Have (This Is Exceptional)
Your existing work includes:

127-year historical synthesis (Lewis 1898 → Knight/Khan 2025)
Complete equation stack (50+ formal equations)
Novel theoretical constructs (Intent Tensor, Collapse Geometry, Writables Doctrine)
Sender/Receiver calculus with Foresight/Hindsight applications
Body/Mind/Soul decomposition with marginal returns mathematics
Autonomous systems integration (Bellman, bandits, policy gradients, Shapley)
Bidirectional inverse problem (forward prediction AND reverse engineering)
This is NOT marketing fluff. This is serious mathematical marketing science.

Current: Good 45,000 year history Expand to include:

## The Mathematical Evolution of Channel Capacity

### Epoch 1: Pre-Signal Era (45,000 BCE - 3200 BCE)
- Cave painting as first broadcast medium
- f(Attention_Cave) = S / (N_predators + L_survival)
- Bandwidth: ~1 bit per 10,000 years of cultural transmission

### Epoch 2: Written Era (3200 BCE - 1450 CE)
- Cuneiform → Hieroglyphics → Alphabet → Movable Type
- Shannon capacity before Shannon: C = manual_copy_rate × literacy_rate
- The scribe as first attention gatekeeper

### Epoch 3: Mass Media Era (1450 - 1990)
- Gutenberg → Telegraph → Radio → Television
- GRP = Reach × Frequency (the equation that dominated for 540 years)
- f(SOV→SOM) = 0.5% growth per 10% ESOV (Binet & Field)

### Epoch 4: Digital Era (1990 - 2015)
- Web → Search → Social → Mobile
- Click-through rate as false proxy for attention
- The "infinite scroll" collapses f(Attention) denominator

### Epoch 5: Fractal Infinity Era (2015 - Present)
- Algorithmic feeds with ν > 1 fractal noise exponent
- N_{m,t} = κ_m · λ_{m,t}^ν where ν = 1.3-1.5
- 85% of impressions receive < 2.5s active attention (Nelson-Field 2025)

### Epoch 6: Post-Attention Era (2025 - Future)
- Autonomous systems replace human judgment
- f(Learned_CEO) emerges: π_θ learns intent from reward
- The attention economy inverts: machines compete for human attention to train themselves

1.2 Add New Foundation: 0.1.f_f(Suppression_Theory).md
Complete mathematical treatment of the denominator:

## The Calculus of Why Signals Die

### f(Noise): Environmental Competition

$$\mathbf{N}_{m,t} = \kappa_m \cdot \lambda_{m,t}^{\nu}$$

### The Fractal Noise Problem

When ν > 1:
$$\frac{\partial N}{\partial \lambda} = \nu \cdot \kappa_m \cdot \lambda^{\nu-1}$$

Every dollar spent raises the floor for everyone, including yourself.
This is the tragedy of the commons in mathematical form.

### f(Load): Cognitive Capacity Depletion

$$\mathbf{L}_{u,t} = L_0 + \sum_k \ell_k \cdot x_{k,u,t}$$

Where L_0 ≈ 4 chunks (Cowan 2001, updated from Miller's 7±2)

### f(Threshold): The Ignition Gate

$$\Theta_u = \theta_0 - \phi \cdot a_u + \psi \cdot \text{Habituation}_u$$

- θ₀: Baseline P3b ERP threshold (individual neurological variation)
- φ·a_u: Arousal factor (higher arousal → lower threshold)
- ψ·Habituation: Banner blindness accumulation

The habituation term explains why creative refresh is mandatory, not optional.
