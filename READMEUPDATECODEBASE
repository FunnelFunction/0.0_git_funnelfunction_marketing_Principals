Comprehensive Plan: Bringing Funnel Function to Scientific Credibility
Based on my research, here's a detailed roadmap to transform your repo from compelling thesis to validated science.

Phase 1: Measurement Operationalization
Problem: Your equations reference B (Body), M (Mind), S (Soul), Σ (Suppression) but don't define how to measure them.

1.1 Body (Sensory Strength) - Map to Industry Standards
Use existing validated metrics:

Your Variable	Industry Metric	Source	Measurement
B.viewability	IAB Viewability	MRC Standard	≥50% pixels, ≥1s (display) / ≥2s (video)
B.attention_time	Active Attention	Lumen APM	Eye-tracking seconds per 1000 impressions
B.salience	AU Score	Adelaide	0-100 ML-predicted attention probability
B.threshold	1.5s encoding	Nelson-Field 2025	Minimum for memory formation
Proposed equation update:

# OLD (undefined)
B = creative_quality * viewability * duration_effect

# NEW (operationalized)
B = (AU_score / 100) * IAB_viewable * (1 - exp(-2.8 * active_attention_seconds))
# Where 2.8 calibrated to Nelson-Field's 1.5s threshold (95% at 1.5s)

1.2 Mind (Relevance) - Map to Mental Availability
Use Ehrenberg-Bass methodology:

Your Variable	Industry Metric	Source	Measurement
M.intent_match	CEP Linkage	Ehrenberg-Bass	% of Category Entry Points linked to brand
M.prediction_error	Distinctiveness	Romaniuk methodology	Brand asset recognition in context
M.relevance	Mental Market Share	CEP Research	(Brand CEP links) / (Total category CEP links)
Proposed equation:

# Mental availability score
M = mental_market_share * (1 + prediction_error_coefficient * distinctiveness_score)
# Where prediction_error_coefficient calibrated from A/B testing

1.3 Soul (Resonance) - Operationalize Identity Alignment
This is your hardest variable. Proposed approach:

# Soul = identity congruence via embedding similarity
S = cosine_similarity(brand_embedding, customer_segment_embedding) * affinity_decay

# Where:
# - brand_embedding: NLP embedding of brand's messaging/positioning
# - customer_segment_embedding: NLP embedding of target psychographics  
# - affinity_decay: γ^t historical interaction decay

Validation source: Use Adelaide's brand lift studies showing 41% upper-funnel lift from attention optimization.

1.4 Sigma (Suppression) - Channel-Specific Noise
Create noise benchmarks by channel:

Channel	N (Noise)	L (Load)	Source
TikTok	25-30	3.5-4.0	Your existing estimate + Lumen data
YouTube	12-15	2.0-2.5	Lumen cross-media data
Linear TV	4-6	1.5-2.0	TVision panel data
CTV	6-8	1.5-2.0	Adelaide benchmarks
Print	2-3	1.0-1.5	Industry baseline
Add to repo: 0.4_f(Channel_Noise_Benchmarks)/README.md

Phase 2: Validation Framework
Problem: You reverse-engineer past successes but don't validate forward predictions.

2.1 Integrate with Open-Source MMM Tools
Key resources:

Google Meridian - Bayesian MMM with geo-level data, GPU-optimized
Meta Robyn - Ridge regression + Nevergrad optimization
PyMC-Marketing - Full Bayesian marketing toolbox
Proposed integration:

# funnel_function_validation.py
# Validate f(x) against established MMM frameworks

from pymc_marketing.mmm import MMM
import meridian  # Google's framework

class FunnelFunctionValidator:
    """
    Cross-validate our Master Equation against:
    1. PyMC-Marketing Bayesian MMM
    2. Google Meridian geo-level model
    3. Incrementality experiments (ground truth)
    """
    
    def validate_against_mmm(self, fx_predictions, mmm_predictions, actuals):
        """
        Compare f(x) ROI estimates vs established MMM
        Return: correlation, MAPE, coverage of credible intervals
        """
        pass
    
    def calibrate_with_incrementality(self, experiment_results):
        """
        Use geo-lift or A/B test results to calibrate f(x) parameters
        Per MSI Working Paper 24-147 methodology
        """
        pass

2.2 Validation Methodology (from MSI Report 24-147)
Three-layer validation:

Holdout Testing: Reserve 20% of time periods, predict, compare
Geo-Level Validation: Compare national f(x) vs geo-specific f(x)
Incrementality Calibration: Run actual experiments, calibrate coefficients
Add to repo: 0.5_f(Validation_Methodology)/README.md

Phase 3: Complete Incomplete Sections
Create content for all "Coming Soon" placeholders:

File	Content Needed	Equation Focus
0.2.a.i f(Awareness)	Expand from TOF README	P(awareness) = σ(α·A - β)
0.2.a.ii f(Lead_Generation)	Lead capture mechanics	Lead_rate = B·M / (N + θ_form)
0.2.b.i f(Nurturing)	Drip vs behavior-triggered	Engagement(t) = Σ γ^(t-τ) · touch(τ)
0.2.b.ii f(Qualification)	BANT/MEDDIC formalization	Q = Π(BANT_factors) · P(close)
0.2.c.i f(Conversion)	Decision psychology	P(convert) = σ(value - λ·loss)
0.2.c.ii f(Close)	Negotiation/pricing	ZOPA = [seller_min, buyer_max]
0.3.a f(Recursive_Collapse)	Full paper	P_collapse = exp(-(ΔΨ)²/2σ²)
0.3.b f(Field_Acquisition)	Full paper	Acquisition = ∫∫ Φ(x)·Ψ(x) dx
0.3.c f(Autonomous_ROI)	Full paper	π* = argmax_a Q*(s,a)
0.3.d f(Learned_Policy)	Full paper	θ ← θ + α∇_θJ(θ)

4.2 Key Implementation: Shapley Attribution
From Google Ads Data Hub methodology:

# attribution/shapley.py
import itertools
import numpy as np

def shapley_attribution(channels: list, value_function: callable) -> dict:
    """
    Compute Shapley values for marketing channel attribution
    
    φ_i(v) = Σ_{S⊆N\{i}} [|S|!(n-|S|-1)!/n!] · [v(S∪{i}) - v(S)]
    
    Args:
        channels: List of channel names
        value_function: f(coalition) -> revenue contribution
    
    Returns:
        Dict mapping channel -> Shapley value (attribution %)
    """
    n = len(channels)
    shapley_values = {ch: 0.0 for ch in channels}
    
    for i, channel in enumerate(channels):
        others = [c for c in channels if c != channel]
        
        for size in range(len(others) + 1):
            for coalition in itertools.combinations(others, size):
                coalition_set = set(coalition)
                
                # Marginal contribution
                v_with = value_function(coalition_set | {channel})
                v_without = value_function(coalition_set)
                marginal = v_with - v_without
                
                # Shapley weight
                weight = (np.math.factorial(size) * 
                          np.math.factorial(n - size - 1) / 
                          np.math.factorial(n))
                
                shapley_values[channel] += weight * marginal
    
    return shapley_values

Phase 5: Falsifiable Case Study
Pick ONE company and make a forward prediction that can fail:

5.1 Proposed: Peloton 18-Month Prediction
From your README:

Peloton: Current f(x) = 0.87 → Target f(x) = 9.4 in 18 months Required move: Drop Σ from 42 → 8 (price cut + identity shift from luxury to essential)

Make this falsifiable:

## Peloton Prediction (December 2025 → June 2027)

### Hypothesis
If Peloton executes:
- Price reduction from $1,445 → $995 (31% cut)
- Messaging shift: "luxury fitness" → "daily essential"
- Σ reduction from 42 → 15 (friction removal)

Then:
- Monthly active users increase 40-60%
- Revenue per user decreases 25-35%  
- Total revenue increases 15-25%
- f(x) score increases from 0.87 → 6.0-9.4

### Measurement Protocol
1. Track Peloton quarterly earnings (MAU, RPU, total revenue)
2. Run monthly f(x) calculation with updated inputs
3. Compare prediction intervals vs actuals

### Falsification Criteria
Prediction FAILS if:
- f(x) < 3.0 after 12 months despite price cut
- MAU increase < 20% despite Σ reduction
- Model systematically over/under-predicts by >50%

Add to repo: 0.6_f(Predictions)/peloton_2025_2027.md

Phase 6: Academic Rigor
6.1 Remove/Revise Hyperbolic Claims
Current Claim	Revised Version
"The most dangerous piece of open-source software in business"	"A mathematical framework for marketing measurement"
"We don't guess anymore. We solve."	"This framework enables quantitative hypothesis testing"
"Ryan Reynolds achieved 99.4% identity congruence"	"Our model estimates Π ≈ 0.99 for Mint Mobile, pending validation"
"The death of the funnel"	"An alternative to stage-gate funnel models"
6.2 Add Limitations Section
## Limitations and Future Work

### Known Limitations
1. **Parameter estimation**: B, M, S coefficients are estimated from limited case studies
2. **Validation gap**: Forward predictions not yet tested against holdout data
3. **Soul measurement**: Identity alignment (Π) lacks standardized measurement protocol
4. **Channel specificity**: Noise benchmarks extrapolated from limited studies

### Required for Scientific Validation
1. Pre-registered predictions with falsification criteria
2. Comparison against established MMM frameworks (Meridian, Robyn)
3. Incrementality experiment calibration
4. Independent replication of coefficient estimates

### Relationship to Loss Aversion Research
Our Σ (suppression) includes status quo bias and loss aversion effects.
Note: Original λ = 2.25 estimate (Tversky & Kahneman 1992) has been revised 
downward in meta-analyses to λ ≈ 1.5-2.0 (see [meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487024000485)).
